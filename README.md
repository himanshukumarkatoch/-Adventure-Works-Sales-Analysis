These are dynamic cards with trend lines and goal comparisons:  
  
First, the Total Profit stands at ‚Çπ771.58K, which is 2.77% above the target of ‚Çπ750.75K ‚Äî indicating that the company is operating profitably.  
  
Second, the Total Orders are 2,146, slightly below the goal of 2,165 by 0.88%. This highlights a minor dip in demand, which may need further analysis.  
  
Third, the Total Revenue has reached ‚Çπ1.83 million, surpassing the target of ‚Çπ1.77 million by 3.31%, reflecting strong sales performance overall.  
  
On the left, I‚Äôve shown Total Orders by Category ‚Äì Accessories, Bikes, and Clothing.
‚Ä¢	This visual is interactive: when a user clicks a specific category, like Accessories, they can drill through to a detailed product-level report.
‚Ä¢	This drill through page is connected to Product Details, where users can explore metrics like return rate, revenue, and units sold for each product in the selected category.
‚Ä¢	"I created a visual that displays the Top 5 Subcategories based on Total Orders to highlight our best-performing product areas. This filter helps stakeholders quickly identify where the business is gaining the most traction.
